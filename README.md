## Highlight something in your project that you thought was especially interesting or significant to your overall implementation.
I feel like Chakra UI played an important role with me being able to add styling to the app and accessibility.

## Tell us what you are most pleased or proud of with your implementation.
I am proud of the implementation of Tanstack Query. It helped minimize code and cleaned the code base.

## Given more time, what next feature or improvement would you like to add
to your project?
If I had more time I would improved the search request. At the moment its making request every time a letter is typed.
I would also add unlimited scrolling, darkmode and better styling.
